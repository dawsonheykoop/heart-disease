# heart-disease-prediction
Trying to produce a model using a public data set "processed.cleveland.csv" from the UCI Machine Learning repository that has information regarding patients with attributes that could relate directly to heart disease.

This is an attempt of an ML project on my own. The process goes as follows...


## 1. Determining the right question
- what are the goals?
- what are the performance requirements?
- what data are we using?


## 2. Preparing the data
This part is the most tedious and lengthy step of the entire process. Most ML projects dedicate 80% of the total time on this part. For this project we are using pretty pristine heart disease data from the UCI ML Repository.


## 3. Selecting the correct algorithm (In progress)
